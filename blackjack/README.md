# BlackJack Game (Backend Only)

Not really a data science project, but I love it all the same.  This program is a fully functional Blackjack game you can use with your terminal.

Built entirely in Python to demonstrate the power that comes from Object Orientation, simply download the files above and run `python3 Blackjack.py`
