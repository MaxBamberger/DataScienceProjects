# Data Science Projects
Welcome! This is a collection of some great Machine Learning, Statistical modeling and Natural Language Processing projects to be used for demonstration or a proof of concept. Feel free to fork or reach out to me if any questions. More to come as I clean up some code..

## Contents:
 - [Predicting movie success](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/film-success-classifier) using a GradientBoosting classifier and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to Topic-Model the plot-synopsis
  - [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/NB-sentiment-analysis) Using a Naive Bayes classifier to learn sentiment from an Roman-Urdu language dataset, plus alternative apporaches including SMOTE for dealing with data imbalances. 
 - [Predicting Customer Churn](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/churn-model) amongst users of a ridesharing app  
 - [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/movie_recommender_system) (a recommendation system that produces user recommendations based on predicted ratings and processes new movies / users as they onboard.
 - [Bayesian A/B Testing](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/exploring-bayes) Bayesian statistical hypothesis testing and a Bayesian Updating demonstration
 - [Predicting Boston Home Prices](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/boston-home-prices/Boston-Home-Prices.ipynb) using three different Boosting Regression models. Demonstrating the effect that Learning Rate has on Boosting Algorithms specifically.
  - [using google places API](https://github.com/MaxBamberger/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/places-api) though not really a data science project, this is a useful tool for hitting and interacting with the google places API ReSTful service to validate address and location data. I've re-purposed it many times.
 
 ## Coming Soon:
 - Detecting Fraud using XGBoost / Random Forest 
 - Image Processing and classification using sci-kit image and Tensorflow
