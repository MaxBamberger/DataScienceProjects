## Notes

The `churn_train.csv` and `churn_test.csv` files are an 80:20 train-test-split of the `churn.csv` data.  For some friendly competition, students should only use the `churn_train.csv` file for model and hyperparameter selection, and then at the end of the day see how they do on the unseen `churn_test.csv.`

Honor code, people!
