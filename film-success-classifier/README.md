# Fame or Flop: Predicting a Film's Success Using historical data, Natural Language Processing (LDA) and Machine Learning

Hollywood is a ruthless business. Success means becoming rich and famous. But the stakes are high: 
70% of movies that are made have a negative ROI.. Meaning they lose money for the original production studios. Many producers, writers and actors struggle their entire life in vain for just a small glimmer of the limelight.

**What if you could know with more certainty if a movie has a real shot at success before your money is sunk?**

Lots of people complain that "movies these days are so formuliac".. Well, there may be some truth to that statement. I've set out to create a machine learning classification system that when trained with over 7000+ films throughout history -- gets to the bottom of what this formula is.

### About the model:
 - Main classifier algorithm: GradientBoosting
 - Plot Synopsis text: Latent Drichlet Allocation (Topic Modeling)
