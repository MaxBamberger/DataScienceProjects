# Fame or Flop: Predicting a Film's Success Using historical data, Natural Language Processing (LDA) and Machine Learning

Hollywood is a ruthless business that, if played right, can make you rich and famous. But the stakes are high: 
70% of movies that are made have a negative ROI.. Meaning they lose money for the original production studios

### About the model:
 - Main classifier algorithm: GradientBoosting
 - Plot Synopsis text: Latent Drichlet Allocation (Topic Modeling)
