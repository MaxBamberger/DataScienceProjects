# Fame or Flop? 
## Predicting the Success of a Film's Using Historical Data, Natural Language Processing (LDA) and Machine Learning

Hollywood is a ruthless business. Success means becoming rich and famous. But the stakes are high: 
70% of movies that are made have a negative ROI.. Meaning they lose money for the original production studios. Many producers, writers and actors struggle their entire life in vain for just a small glimmer of the limelight.

**What if you could know with more certainty if a movie has a real shot at success before your money is sunk?**

Lots of people complain that "movies these days are so formuliac".. Well, there may be some truth to that statement. I've set out to create a machine learning classification system that when trained with over 7000+ films throughout history -- gets to the bottom of what this formula is.

You can [make a prediction](http://0.0.0.0:8081/) with my model 
(this is a web-app I put together for demonstration. I never claimed to be a great web-developer :))

### About the model itself:
