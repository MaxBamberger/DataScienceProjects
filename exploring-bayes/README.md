## Goals
You will understand:
- the trade-offs between the power of a test, the significance,
  sample size and detectable effect size
- Bayesian updating to calculate outcomes as a probabilistic distribution (posterior) 
  based on a prior distribution and a likelihood function

Morning Exercise: [individual.md](individual.md)

Afternoon Exercise: [pair.md](pair.md)

## Readings
- `power_derivation.pdf` explains what statistical power is and the best practices
  of using power calculations within an experimental setup
