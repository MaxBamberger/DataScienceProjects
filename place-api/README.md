# Places API
This is a script that can be used and repurposed to validate address and name data against Google Places API for free.

The script was originally developed for sending address data from static exports of a cable operator's billing data (the two biggest billing systems in the industry: CSG and ICOMS) but the script can be easily re-configured for any account-level dataset for which you need to validate the address and establishment type with Google's API.

## Requirements
Will require an API Key from Google in order to use:
